Banded crunch isometric hold,"The banded crunch isometric hold is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. The band adds resistance and continuous tension to this popular exercise."
FYR Banded Plank Jack,"The banded plank jack is a variation on the plank that involves moving the legs in and out for repetitions. Having a band around the thighs forces the lower body to work harder, particularly the hips and glutes. The plank jack is commonly performed as part of a bodyweight circuit, or as part of a dynamic warm-up."
Banded crunch,"The banded crunch is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. The band adds resistance and continuous tension to this popular exercise."
Crunch,"The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the rectus abdominis, or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques. It has been the centerpiece of many ab-focused workouts, due to both its simplicity and the intense burn and mind-muscle connection it produces. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."

Kettlebell swing,"The kettlebell swing is a popular lower-body exercise emphasizing the hamstrings, glutes, and back muscles. It is often used to train explosive power, for aerobic or cardiovascular conditioning, in circuit training, or as an accessory movement for the deadlift."
Two-way swing,"The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a ""Russian"" or ""hardstyle"" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an ""American"" swing). Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing."
Kettlebell crab reach,"The kettlebell crab reach is a kettlebell pressing exercise in which the lifter presses a kettlebell overhead while in a modified single-arm bridge position.

Ab wheel roll-out,The ab wheel roll-out is an exercise targeting the abdominals using an inexpensive wheel device with a handle on either side. Many trainers and strength coaches claim it's one of the best exercises for developing strength in the midsection. Beginners may have to start with a limited range of motion or just wheel planks.
Bench mountain climber,"The bench mountain climber is a bodyweight exercise that works the core, shoulders, and lower body while burning a lot of calories. Placing the hands on an elevated surface such as a bench decreases the challenge to the shoulders, allowing lifters to focus their work on the other body parts. Mountain climber variations are usually performed at a fast pace for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per leg or more."
Feet-elevated bench side plank,"The feet-elevated bench side plank is an advanced version of the side plank performed with the feet elevated on a bench. It targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but the body angle makes it more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank first."
Cross-body sit-up,"The cross-body sit-up is a bodyweight exercise targeting the ab muscles, the obliques and rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It involves bringing the opposite-side knee and elbow together, usually alternating sides with each rep. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Decline kayak,"The decline kayak is a core exercise targeting the obliques. It involves making a paddling motion on a decline bench with the feet anchored, using a bar or pipe for weight.

It targets multiple muscles of the core, but particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. It can be performed for time or reps in the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Chin-up crunch,The chin-up crunch is an exercise targeting the core and overall upper-body strength. It combines a chin-up with a knee raise or crunch to give extra emphasis to the core.
30 Gorilla Chin Oblique Crunch,
Half Turkish get-up,"The half Turkish get-up is a kettlebell movement that focuses on the first portion of the Turkish get-up exercise. It is often taught as a precursor to the full Turkish get-up, but is also a valuable abdominal and shoulder exercise in its own right. It can be performed for reps or time, either in lower rep ranges for strength or higher rep ranges for technique practice or conditioning."
30 Hanging Oblique Crunch,"The hanging oblique crunch an abdominal exercise that targets both the rectus abdominus or “six-pack” muscles, and the oblique muscles. It can be performed hanging from a bar, or if grip strength is a limitation, by placing the elbows in ab straps. If hanging from a straight bar is uncomfortable to the wrists or shoulder, you can also perform them hanging with a neutral grip (palms facing one another)"
30 Hollow-Body Hold,"The hollow-body hold is an isometric exercise that increases strength and stability in the core muscles. It is common in gymnastics training, CrossFit training, and as a core tension and bracing drill for lifters and athletes of all types. It is performed for time and can be performed as an activation drill prior to lifting, as part of a circuit, or as equipment-free core training anytime."
Parallel bars knee raise,"The parallel bars knee raise is a bodyweight exercise that targets the abs. It is performed on parallel bars, starting in the top position of a dip. Knee raises are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of ab-focused training."
30 Landmine Twist,"The landmine twist is a rotational abdominal movement performed utilizing an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. It targets the deep muscles of the core, including both the obliques and the transversus abdominus. It can be done fast or slow, for time or reps, either in traditional muscle-focused rep ranges such as 8-12 reps per side."
Parallel bars leg raise,"The parallel bars leg raise is a bodyweight exercise that targets the abs. It is performed on parallel bars, starting in the top position of a dip. Leg raises are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of ab-focused training. However, this difficult variation may require some time to build up to those rep ranges."
Otis-up-,"The Otis-up is a weighted exercise focusing on the abdominal muscles and the shoulders to a lesser degree. It primarily targets the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles, but also involves the obliques and deep core muscles. It is normally performed on a decline bench holding a weight plate, but can also be performed with a dumbbell, kettlebell, or other weight."
30 Shoulder Tap,"The shoulder tap is an exercise targeting the abdominals and core. The basic stance matches the top of a push-up position. From there, one hand is raised to tap its opposing shoulder. A tap with each hand to each opposing shoulder equals one rep."
30 Spider Crawl,"The spider crawl is a bodyweight exercise that involves crawling on the floor with the knees outside of the elbows. It is different from a leopard crawl in that the hips are higher, and it's different from a bear crawl because the knees are wider. It can be done as a full-body warm-up, in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning."
Spider crunch,"The spider crunch is a core exercise that begins in a straight-arm plank position and involves raising one knee toward your same-side elbow to target the obliques. It is similar to a mountain climber, but with the knees out wider. It can be performed for time or reps as bodyweight ab training or conditioning."
Toe-touch,"The toe-touch is a bodyweight movement that targets the muscles of the abs, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It can be performed for time or reps in the ab-focused portion of any workout."
30 Hanging Toes-To-Bar,"The hanging toes-to-bar is an advanced abdominal exercise in which the lifter touches their feet to a pull-up bar. There are many ways to perform this movement: strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent, each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps."
30 V-Up,"The V-up is a bodyweight movement that targets the muscles of the abs, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It is similar to a suitcase crunch, but the lower back lifts off the ground at the top of each rep. It can be performed for time or reps in the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Cocoon crunch,"The cocoon crunch is a bodyweight exercise targeting the ab muscles, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It involves bringing your knees to your chest and your arms from overhead to center. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Bench oblique crunch,"The bench oblique crunch is an exercise that targets the obliques, the muscles running alongside the rectus abdominis. The range of motion is fairly small, but it still does a great job of working these hard-to-isolate muscles. Like most crunch variations, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."
Full moon-,"The full moon is a bodyweight exercise targeting the muscles of the abs. It is similar to a V-up, but with the added challenge of “drawing” a circle shape in the air during each rep. It can be performed for time or reps in the core-focused portion of any workout."
Push-up to side plank,"The push-up to side plank is an upper-body and core-focused exercise combining two popular bodyweight movements.

The simple addition of a weight makes the suitcase crunch far more difficult, helping build the ""six pack"" muscles and providing a different stimulus to the core during training."
Medicine ball rotational throw,"The medicine ball rotational throw is an explosive exercise targeting the abdominals, including the obliques, as well as the hips and upper back. It involves standing sideways to the wall and twisting the torso to hurl a medicine ball into the wall, then catching the ball on the ricochet. It can be performed for lower reps with a focus on power, or for higher reps with a focus on fat loss and conditioning."
Hollow-hold ball toss,"The hollow-hold ball toss is a more difficult version of the hollow-body hold exercise. It involves tossing a ball to a partner while maintaining an isometric hold in the hollow-body position. It can be done for reps or time in any ab-focused workout, or in an ""I go, you go"" format."
Partner front Russian twist and pass,"The partner front Russian twist and pass is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise that also utilizes a training partner to add another dynamic component. It targets the oblique muscles, as well as the deep muscles of the core and the rectus abdominis or ""six pack"" muscles. It can be done for reps or time in an ab-focused portion of any workout."
Sit-up with single-arm overhand throw,"The sit-up with single-arm overhand throw is an exercise targeting the core muscles, but the inclusion of the throw also brings in other upper-body muscles. When you come to the top of the sit-up position, you throw a medicine ball using one arm to a partner who then throws it right back to you to be caught with both hands. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Medicine ball partner twist,"The medicine ball partner twist is a plyometrics exercise targeting the core muscles, particularly the obliques. You and a partner stand back to back and rotate in unison to pass a medicine ball back and forth on alternating sides."
Partner side Russian twist and pass,"The partner side Russian twist and pass is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise that also utilizes a training partner to add another dynamic component. It primarily targets the oblique muscles, as well as the deep muscles of the core and the rectus abdominis or ""six pack"" muscles.

Suspended Curl,
Plate hammer curl,"The plate hammer curl is an exercise that targets the long head of the biceps as well as the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles. Typically hammer curls are done with dumbbells, but in this case, holding a weight plate places the hands in the same neutral position."
Barbell spider curl,"The barbell spider curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face down on either an incline bench or on the flat side of a preacher bench. The vertical bench angle helps to isolate the biceps and limit involvement of the shoulder muscles. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training."
Barbell forehead curl,"The barbell forehead curl is a classic movement from the Golden Age of bodybuilding and is often associated with Dave ""The Blond Bomber"" Draper. The barbell is brought up to your forehead instead of to your chest, emphasizing the squeeze and peak contraction. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set."
Overhead cable curl,"Also known as a crucifix curl, the overhead cable curl is a biceps-focused exercise performed between two cable stacks, using a pair of D-handles. The arms and elbows are held at shoulder height throughout the movement, and both hands curl in toward the ears. This position is designed to eliminate shoulder involvement and momentum, while targeting the biceps peak. This movement is generally done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of arm-focused training."
Standing One-Arm Cable Curl,The single-arm cable biceps curl is a single-joint isolation exercise for building the biceps. This move is intended to be strict and deliberate; this is not an exercise for using momentum or otherwise cheating.
Reverse Cable Curl,
Standing Biceps Cable Curl,"The cable straight-bar biceps curl takes a classic bodybuilding exercise, the standing barbell curl, and replaces the barbell with a handle attached to a cable. This is a common burnout move performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout."
Cable rope hammer curl,"The cable rope hammer curl is a popular arm-focused exercise performed with a rope handle attached by a cable to a weight stack. It uses a neutral (palms facing one another) grip, which targets the forearms and brachialis muscles in addition to the biceps. Because grip is a limitation, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."
Lying cable biceps curl,"The lying cable biceps curl is a cable exercise that targets the biceps. It is performed lying on the back, either on a bench or the ground, with the feet facing toward a cable stack. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps for a burn and pump as part of an arm-focused workout."
Cable rope preacher hammer curl,"The cable rope preacher hammer curl is a single-joint arm exercise that builds strength and size in the biceps using a cable stack, a preacher bench, and a rope grip. The neutral or ""hammer"" grip amplifies activation of both the grip and the brachialis muscles, building arm thickness. The angle of the bench also effectively removes the shoulders from the movement, largely isolating the biceps. It is generally performed for higher reps, at least 8-15 per set."
Lying Close-Grip Bar Curl On High Pulley,The lying high-cable biceps curl is an unusual move for building the biceps—but it’s a highly effective one. Lying prone and curling down toward you provides a different stimulus than more standard approaches allow.
Cable EZ-Bar Preacher Curl - Gethin Variation,"The cable preacher curl is a single-joint arm exercise that builds strength and size in the biceps using a cable stack and a preacher bench. It is popular in muscle-building arm workouts because the angle of the bench effectively removes the shoulders from the movement, largely isolating the biceps. It is generally performed for higher reps, at least 8-15 per set."
Squatting cable EZ-bar biceps curl,"The squatting cable EZ-bar biceps curl is an exercise that builds and strengthens the biceps while the lower body is in a static squat position. It is usually performed for higher rep sets, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, in combination with other curls or arm training. It is most similar in arm positioning to a preacher curl, but has some unique benefits to the lower body, as well."
Cable straight-bar biceps curl,"The cable straight-bar biceps curl takes a classic bodybuilding exercise, the standing barbell curl, and replaces the barbell with a handle attached to a cable. This is a common burnout move performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout."
Standing reverse-grip cable curl,"The standing reverse-grip cable curl takes a classic bodybuilding exercise, the reverse barbell curl, and tweaks it by using a handle attached to a cable stack instead. It targets the forearm muscles and brachialis to a greater degree than underhand biceps curl variations. Because grip is a limitation, this move is commonly performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout."

It is popular in high-rep ""pump""-style arm workouts. The bands should be placed as high as possible on your arms, at a tightness of no greater than 8 on a scale of 10. Most BFR workouts recommend using a far lighter weight than usual, perhaps as low as 25-50 percent of a normal working weight."
Machine Bicep Curl,
Machine Preacher Curls,The machine preacher curl is an isolation exercise targeting the biceps.
Single-arm machine preacher curl,"The single-arm machine preacher curl is a popular exercise to build size and strength in the biceps. It approximates the motion of a free-weight preacher curl, but uses a selectorized weight stack or plate-loaded machine. Many such machines offer different grips and grip widths. Machine biceps curls are often done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or arm-focused portion of a workout."

TBS Chin-Up,"The a chin-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing toward the body, in an underhand position, with a grip that is narrower than shoulder-width. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand pull-ups. It can be used as a more shoulder-friendly alternative to straight-bar pull-ups, or to help perform more reps than you can perform overhand."
Pull-up - Gethin Variation,"The pull-up is a multi-joint bodyweight exercise that builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core. It is often used as a measurement tool in military or tactical fitness tests, and is an excellent gauge of “relative strength” which is strength in relation to bodyweight."

Band push-up,"The band push-up is a progression of the popular bodyweight version of the exercise commonly used in military and tactical physical fitness tests. Adding the dynamic resistance of the band matches the strength curve of the push-up and helps build upper-body muscle and strength, emphasizing the chest, triceps, and shoulders, but also working the upper back and core."
Band chest fly,"Similar to the cable chest fly, the band chest fly is a single-joint movement that works the pectoral muscles. The fly is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, and the band variation works well as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout or a finishing movement at the end. It is often used in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles."
Close-grip bench press,"The close-grip bench press is a popular exercise targeting the triceps and chest. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands and elbows are placed closer together, which places more of an emphasis on the triceps.

Spoto press,"The Spoto press is a variation of the popular barbell exercise the bench press that builds strength and muscle in the chest, triceps, and shoulders. It differs from the bench press in that the lifter pauses for a few seconds at the bottom of the movement before pressing the bar back up. This pause removes all momentum and increases the time under tension for the chest and shoulder muscles to help develop upper-body musculature and strength."
Kettlebell plyo push-up,"The kettlebell plyo push-up is an explosive upper-body movement that uses a kettlebell primarily as a platform for the hands. A short step, dumbbell, or other stationary object could also be used in place of the kettlebell. It can be performed for reps or time, either for low reps to build explosive power or for higher reps for conditioning."
Extended Range One-Arm Kettlebell Floor Press,
Kettlebell alternating floor press,"The kettlebell alternating floor press limits the range of motion you would achieve with a dumbbell or kettlebell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. This allows you to build strength in the top portion of the lift, overload the triceps, and work on strengthening the shoulder stabilizers."
One-Arm Kettlebell Floor Press,
Leg-Over Floor Press,
FYR2 Push-Up to Kettlebell Hike Combo,

Wide-grip hands-elevated push-up,"The wide-grip hands-elevated push-up is a variation on the elevated push-up performed with the hands farther apart than with a standard push-up. Having the hands higher than the feet makes it easier than wide-grip push-ups on the floor, but the extra width also puts more emphasis on the chest muscles. It can be used as a substitute for wide-grip floor push-ups, or as a mechanical dropset after maxing out on floor push-ups."
Push-Ups With Feet On An Exercise Ball,
Feet-elevated push-up,"The feet-elevated push-up is a variation on the push-up, a bodyweight standard. The feet are elevated so that your body is aligned at an angle to the floor rather than parallel. This makes it more difficult than push-ups on the floor, but also puts more emphasis on the shoulder muscles. It is often used as a bodyweight substitute for incline presses, or as a burnout movement for a chest or shoulder workout."
Isometric Wipers,The typewriter push-up is an advanced push-up variation where the hands are extra wide and you lower toward each hand in alternating reps. It is more challenging to each working arm than traditional push-ups and also stretches and challenges the chest.
Clock push-up,"The clock push-up is a series of regular push-ups performed one at a time, moving your hands one step to the side between each one until you've completed a full circle. It targets the same muscles as traditional push-ups, such as the chest, triceps, and shoulders, but adds an endurance and core challenge to traditional push-ups."
Incline Push-Up Depth Jump,
Push-Up Wide,"The wide push-up is a variation of the push-up with the hands wider than shoulder-width apart. It targets upper-body muscle groups including the chest, shoulders, and triceps, but has more of a chest emphasis than narrower-grip push-up variations. If wide push-ups lead to pain in the front of your shoulder, opt for a narrower version."
Sphinx push-up,"The sphinx push-up is a difficult variation of the push-up that ends with the forearms on the ground in front of the body, rather than with the chest on the ground. It puts more stress on the triceps than traditional push-ups. It can be performed for time or reps in any bodyweight workout or during any arms-focused portion of a workout."
Close-Hands Push-Up,"The close push-up is an upper-body exercise that targets the chest, triceps, and shoulders. The close hand position places more emphasis on the triceps."

Lower back SMR,"Lower back self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other ""trigger point"" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the quadratus lumborum or spinal erector (erector spinae) muscles of the lower back, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or ""release."" Lower back SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the glutes or piriformis muscles, or by stretches that target the piriformis or hips. However, some people find that SMR on the lower back can aggravate existing pain or injury, so be cautious when performing it."

It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout."
Dumbbell seated box jump,"The dumbbell seated box jump is an explosive exercise that builds the quadriceps as well as overall lower-body strength and explosiveness. All you need is a box, a bench, and a light dumbbell. Performing it from a seated position eliminates the stretch reflex in the lower body, forcing you to generate more power. This is an advanced move, so consider starting off with box jumps or squat jumps before progressing to this."
Dumbbell step-up,"The dumbbell step-up is a great exercise for building lower-body strength and power. It targets all the same muscles as bodyweight step-ups, such as the quads, glutes, and hamstrings, but allows for greater muscular overload."

It can also be performed with a weight plate or dumbbell, providing a neutral grip that may be more shoulder-friendly for some lifters. Overhead raises are most common for high reps (at least 8-12 reps per set or higher) on a shoulder, trap, or other upper-body-focused muscle-building day."
Incline barbell shoulder protraction,"The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."
Behind-the-head push-press,The behind-the-head push-press is an overhead press variation in which the barbell starts in the back rack position and is pushed overhead with assistance from the lower body.

The half-kneeling press can be used as an accessory lift for the shoulder press or bench press, or simply as a technique to make shoulder presses stricter and more athletic."
Dumbbell Clean And Jerk,
Dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation,"The dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation is a twist on the traditional dumbbell shoulder press. Rather than pressing straight overhead, you twist your torso and hips to the side during each rep. It hits the deltoid muscles just like a shoulder press, but adds a challenge to the core, hips, and back muscles. Due to the potential balance challenge of twisting and pressing at the same time, it is commonly performed with light to moderate weights."

The bar should actually come down behind the head. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper body or arms-focused workout. No need to chase a 1RM on this move!"
